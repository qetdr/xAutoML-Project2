## Files and Directories
- `tpot_models/`: directory that includes the python files for TPOT models (results)
  - tpot_X1.py: results for Model 1 (less features)
  - tpot_X2.py: results for Model 2 (more features)
- `README.md`: the present file that includes the project meta-information
- `autosklearn_approach.ipynb`: a notebook where we initially tried to implement the `auto-sklearn` approach; not used in the final solution.
- `interpretability.ipynb`: a notebook that includes the interpreatibility part; pre-requisite is the existence of TPOT model files
- `requirements.txt`: python packages for installing
- `tpot_approach.ipynb`: a notebook with the TPOT implementation as the automated ML approach
